[1] "Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collabora-tive filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of avail- A ble information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender sys-tems. These are: Producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of partici-pants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recom-mendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative fil-tering techniques. Item-based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze different item-based recommen-dation generation algorithms. We look into different tech-niques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we ex-perimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments sug-gest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available user-based algorithms."     
[2] "Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)."
[3] "Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information. However, as recent experience shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files.We describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that assigns each peer a unique global trust value, based on the peer's history of uploads. We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network.In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network, even under a variety of conditions where malicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
[4] "Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)."                                                                                                                                               
[5] "This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the \"LINE,\" which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online."

[2] "first, a little background: it is no secret that i am implementing an auth+auth system for codeigniter, and so far i'm winning (so to speak). but i've run into a pretty non-trivial challenge (one that most auth libraries miss entirely, but i insist on handling it properly): how to deal intelligently with large-scale, distributed, variable-username brute-force attacks.  i know all the usual tricks:   limiting # of failed attempts per ip/host and denying the offenders access (e.g. failban) - which no longer works since botnets have grown smarter combining the above with a blacklist of known 'bad' ips/hosts (e.g. denyhosts) - which relies on botnets falling for #, which they increasingly don't ip/host whitelists combined with traditional auth (sadly useless with dynamic ip users and the high churn on most web sites) setting a sitewide limit on # of failed attempts within a n minute/hour period, and throttling (suspending) all login attempts after that for a number of minutes/hours (with the problem that dos attacking you becomes botnet child's play) mandatory digital signatures (public-key certificates) or rsa hardware tokens for all users with no login/password option (without question a rock-solid solution, but only practical for closed, dedicated services) enforced ultra-strong password schemes (e.g. > nonsense characters with symbols - again, too impractical for casual users) and finally, captchas (which could work in most cases, but are annoying for users and virtually useless against a determined, resourceful attacker)   now, these are just the theoretically workable ideas. there are plenty of rubbish ideas that blow the site wide open (e.g. to trivial dos attacks). what i want is something better. and by better, i mean:   it has to be secure(+) against dos and brute-force attacks, and not introduce any new vulnerabilities that might allow a slightly sneakier bot to continue operating under the radar it has to be automated. if it requires a human operator to verify each login or monitor suspicious activity, it's not going to work in a real-world scenario it has to be feasible for mainstream web use (ie. high churn, high volume, and open registration that can be performed by non-programmers) it can't impede the user experience to the point where casual users will get annoyed or frustrated (and potentially abandon the site) it can't involve kittens, unless they are really really secure kittens   (+) by 'secure', i mean at least as secure as a paranoid user's ability to keep his password secret  so - let's hear it! how would you do it? do you know of a best-practice that i haven't mentioned (oh please say you do)? i admit i do have an idea of my own (combining ideas from  and ), but i'll let the true experts speak before embarrassing myself ;-) "

[5] "i manage a group of programmers. i do value my employees opinion but lately we've been divided as to which framework to use on web projects.  i personally favor mootools, but some of my team seems to want to migrate to jquery because it is more widely adopted. that by itself is not enough for me to allow a migration.  i have used both jquery and mootools. this particular essay tends to reflect how i feel about both frameworks. jquery is great for dom manipulation, but seem to be limited to helping you do that.  feature wise, both jquery and mootools allow for easy dom selection and manipulation:    jquery offers the following extras:   large community of supporters plugin repository integration with microsoft's asp.net and visualstudio used by microsoft, google and others   mootools offers the following extras:   object oriented framework with classic oop emulation for js extended native objects higher consistency between browsers for native functions support. more easy code reuse used by the world wide web consortium, palm and others.   given that, it seems that mootools does everything jquery does and more (some things i cannot do in jquery and i can in mootools) but jquery has a smaller learning curve.  so the question is, why did you or your team choose jquery over another javascript framework?  note: while i know and admit jquery is a great framework, there are other options around and i'm trying to take a decision as to why jquery should be our choice versus what we use right now (mootools)?
